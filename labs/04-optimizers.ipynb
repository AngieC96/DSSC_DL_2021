    "\n",
    "Warm-up is a techinque which is centered on the idea that, before we start the actual training, the network has to be _warmed-up_ with some iterations of training at an ever-increasing LR, till we hit the target LR $\\eta$.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Now that you have all the tools to train an MLP with high performance on MNIST, try reaching 0-loss on the training data (with a small epsilon -- don't worry if you overfit!).\n",
    "The implementation is completely up to you. You just need to keep it an MLP without using fancy layers (e.g., keep the `Linear` layers, don't go into `Conv1d` or somthing like this). You are free to use any LR scheduler or optimizer, any one of batchnorm/groupnorm, regularization methods... If you use something we haven't seen during lectures, please motivate your choice and explain (as briefly as possible) how it works.\n",
    "2. Try reaching 0-loss on the training data with **permuted labels**. Assess the model on the test data (without permuted labels) and comment. Help yourself with [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530).\n",
    "*Tip*: To permute the labels, act on the `trainset.targets` with an appropriate torch function.\n",
    "Then, you can pass this \"permuted\" `Dataset` to a `DataLoader` like so: `trainloader_permuted = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset_permuted, batch_size=batch_size_train, shuffle=True)`. You can now use this `DataLoader` inside the training function.\n",
